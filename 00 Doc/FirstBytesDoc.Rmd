First Bytes 2014 - R Technology Workshop
===
**R is the most popular free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. ggplot2 is a data visualization package for R that can be used to produce publication-quality graphics. This workshop is designed to intrduce you to R and ggplot as well as RStudio, KnitR, Slidify, and Shiny.

###This is how my RStudio is configured:
```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

You also need to install LaTeX if you want to generate PDF files from KnitR.

###Getting Started - Clone the First Bytes GiT Repository:

**Phils-MacBook-Pro:Mine pcannata$ pwd**  
/Users/pcannata/Mine  
**Phils-MacBook-Pro:Mine pcannata$ git clone https://github.com/pcannata/FirstBytesRepo.git**  
Cloning into 'FirstBytesRepo'...

remote: Compressing objects: 100% (12/12), done.  
remote: Total 19 (delta 3), reused 19 (delta 3)  
Unpacking objects: 100% (19/19), done.  
Checking connectivity... done  
**Phils-MacBook-Pro:Mine pcannata$ ls -a FirstBytesRepo/**  
.  		.Rprofile.R		00 Doc			03 ggplot		05 KnitR 02  
..			.git			01 Basic R		04 KnitR 01		FirstBytesRepo.Rproj  

###Getting Started - Create a New RStudio Project for the code in the cloned repository:

###Basic R Language Constructs

See also http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-lang.html, http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction, and http://www.cookbook-r.com/

```{r}
source("../01 Basic R/Basic.R", echo = TRUE)
```

###R Dataframes

See also http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction/data-frame

Many R packages come with demo dataframes. The ggplot package comes with a demo dataframe called diamonds.

```{r}
source("../02 R Dataframes/Dataframes.R", echo = TRUE)
```
For more on subsetting dataframes see http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/faq/subset_R.htm

Dataframes can be loaded from databases, CSVs, Excel, etc. Loading dataframes from these sources will not be covered in this workshop.

###ggplot2
**ggplot is an R package for data exploration and visualization. It produces production quality graphics and allows you to slice and dice your data in many different ways. ggplot uses a general scheme for data visualization which breaks graphs up into semantic components such as scales and layers. In contrast to other graphics packages, ggplot2 allows the user to add, remove or alter components in a plot at a high level of abstraction.**

See also http://ggplot2.org/, http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/ggplot2.pdf, and https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ggplot2

```{r}
source("../03 ggplot/Plots.R", echo = TRUE)
```

**The Chapter 7 of "R for Everyone" has many more examples of ggplots.**

###ggplot2 and functions

```{r}
source("../03 ggplot/plotFunction.R", echo = TRUE)
```

**You should now be able to open FirstBytesRepo/00 Doc/4diamonds.png. It should look like the following plot.**

![](./4diamonds.png) 

###KnitR
**KnitR is an R package designed to generate dynamic reports using a mix of the R, LaTex, and Markdown languages.**  
See also http://yihui.name/knitr/ and http://kbroman.github.io/knitr_knutshell/

**Simple examples can be found in "04 KnitR/doc1.Rmd" and "04 KnitR/doc1.Rmd". These can generate html, pdf, and word documents.**  
**A comprehensive example (which generated this document) can be found in "00 Doc/FirstBytesDoc.Rmd".**  

###slidify
**You can use Slidify to generate HTML slide decks using only the Rmarkdown language.**  

See also http://slidify.org and http://slidify.org/start.html

**Follow the instructions in "05 Slidify/slidify setup.R" to install and run slidify. You should be able to produce a slide deck with a first slide that looks something like the following.** 

![](./slidify.png)  

**Cool trick - Any github repo with a branch called gh-pages will get served as a website. If the content of that repo is the stuff of websites (html,css), then you get free web hosting. So, create a branch called gh-pages and push to it.**  

###shiny
**The shiny R package allows you to build interactive web-based applications using only R with no knowledge of html, css, or javascript needed. You just need to write two scripts:**  

* ui.R : Defines the layout and the interactive elements that the user can access.  
* server.R : Defines what computations are done in response to user interactions.

To run the shiny app that's in the 06Shiny directory run the following in the main FirstBytesRepo directory:  
library(shiny)  
runApp("06Shiny")   

This should pop the application up in a browser, you can also access it in a browser at http://127.0.0.1:6837. It should look like the following.

![](./shiny.png) 

###shinyapps

The example above ran the shiny app on your local machine, but to share with others, you have to send around the R files and the user needs to have R and know a little bit about it.

Instead, you can remotely host shiny apps and then just send people links. Get a free account at shinyapps.io/signup.html and give it a try.

![](./shinyapps.io.png)

![](./pcannata.shinyapps.io.png)

**library("devtools", lib.loc="/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.0/Resources/library")  
install_github( repo = "shinyapps", username="rstudio" )  
shinyapps::setAccountInfo(name='pcannata', token='3ECF447A741004F6A8B7208C9ED778E1', secret='. . . ')**  

```{r}
library(shinyapps)
getwd()
#deployApp("../06Shiny")
```

**Now you try the app at https://pcannata.shinyapps.io/06Shiny/ **
